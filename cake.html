        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <p><ul>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon fine salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons whole milk</li>

        <p><H2>Instructions</H2></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350, and spray a 6" round cake pan with 2" sides with cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium-size bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer. Beat very well, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla, and beat until well-combined, about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda. Add half of the this to the batter and beat for just a few seconds before stirring in half of the milk and vinegar. Continue beating. Add the remaining dry ingredients and beat, and then stir in the remaining milk.</li>
            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smooth out the top, and bake on a small sheet pan for 37-39 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let the cake cool on a wire rack in the pan. Carefully remove it from the pan, pulling away the parchment paper once it has cooled.</li>
            <li>If the frosting is still dry or crumbly, add 1 teaspoon of Milk and mix again.</li>
