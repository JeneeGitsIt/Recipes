        <p>This Buttercream Frosting will make anything you put it on taste better</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <p><ul>
                <li>1 cup Salted Sweet Cream Butter, slightly softened</li>
                <li>2-3 teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>1 pound Powdered Sugar (or 4 cups)</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons Milk (as needed)</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p><H2>Instructions</H2></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add the “slightly softened” Butter (somewhere in between straight out of the refrigerator and room temperature) to the mixing bowl along with the Vanilla Extract.</li>
            <li>Mix the Butter and Vanilla together until they are fully combined (about 2 minutes on medium speed.) You want the Vanilla to fully meld with the Butter to get the best-flavored frosting possible.</li>
            <li>Scrape the sides of the bowl down before moving on to the next step of the recipe.</li>
            <li>Measure 1 pound of Powdered Sugar.  If you don’t have a food scale, the equivalent is 4 cups.</li>
            <li>Add the powdered sugar to the mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Start your mixer (or electric beater) on the lowest setting. Keep on low until the butter and sugar are incorporated (about 30 seconds). Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and mix for 30-45 more seconds until the frosting starts to be light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>If the frosting is still dry or crumbly, add 1 teaspoon of Milk and mix again.</li>
        </ol></p>
